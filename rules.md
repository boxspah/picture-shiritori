# Rules of Game

*Recommendations are marked with an asterisk (\*) and/or explicitly stated as such. They can be ignored, depending on players' preferences.*

## Basic Play

Players take turns submitting a word and a drawing representing the word. The selected word must begin with the same letter as the last letter of the word selected by the preceding player, as is true in Japanese shiritori.

For example,

> basketball --> levitate --> element

The word must not have been already used in the match, regardless of which player used it. Only one form of any given word can be used per match. A form can be a conjugation, an alternate spelling, a plural form, a word with Latin suffix etc. (This is not a comprehensive list of what can be defined as a "form.") It does not matter which form occurs first; all subsequent uses of the word and its forms are illegal.

For example,

> ascend --> dog --> gala --> ~~ascension~~

This is illegal because "ascension" is a derivative of "ascend," which was already used. If "ascend" and "ascension" were to swap order, "ascension" would be valid and the second use of the word (i.e. "ascend") would be illegal.

## Drawing

The drawing must resemble the word selected. Simply writing out the word is not a valid drawing. If the drawing is intended as a joke or is not literally representative of the word, other players must agree that the drawing is acceptable. For example, drawing a pile of poop for "physics" is only valid if other players agree that physics is poop.

The drawing must be done at least partially by hand â€” fully computer-rendered graphics are not allowed, but drawing aids (e.g. shape tools) are okay. Hardware aids, such as a drawing tablet, are allowed*.

The drawing may only be started after the preceding player has ended their turn. Preparing drawings or assets in advance is not allowed. Selecting a colour palette ahead of time is allowed.

## Permitted words

All English words are allowed, with the following restrictions:

- No words ending with 'x', 'y', or 'z';
- No abbreviations or acronyms;
- No proper nouns

It is recommended to use high school level vocabulary so that all players can understand the words played.

### Verification *

[Wiktionary](https://en.wiktionary.org) is the recommended source to check spelling. If unavailable, [Merriam-Webster](https://www.merriam-webster.com) is a good alternative.

## Timers *

The Rulebook recommends allocating at least 3 minutes per turn, from the time that the preceding turn is ended. Failure to submit a word and a drawing within the time will result in losing the match.
