# The Unofficial Rulebook for English Picture Shiritori

[Shiritori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori) (しりとり) is a Japanese word game in which players take turns saying a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word. For example, saku**ra** (さく**ら**) can be followed by **ra**jio (**ラ**ジオ). The game ends when a word is repeated, a word ending with n (ん) is used, or a disallowed word is used.

In *picture* shiritori, players draw and write out the word, instead of saying it out loud. Rules about word repetition and endings still apply.

This rulebook is based on the rules of the original Japanese game, with changes introduced to adapt the game to the English language. We hope this will make English shiritori as popular as its Japanese counterpart.
