# The Unofficial Rulebook for English Picture Shiritori

[Shiritori](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Shiritori) (しりとり) is a Japanese word game in which players take turns saying a word which begins with the final kana of the previous word. For example, saku**ra** (さく**ら**) can be followed by **ra**jio (**ラ**ジオ). The game typically ends when a word is repeated (which is illegal), or a word ending with n (ん) is used (also illegal).

*Picture* shiritori replaces the verbal responses with written responses, often accompanied by a hand-drawn representation of the word. Rules regarding word repetition and endings still apply.

This rulebook is based on the rules of the original Japanese game, but has been modified to better suit the English language. We hope this improves the popularity of English shiritori to the level of its Japanese counterpart.
