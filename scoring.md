# Scoring System

Traditionally, shiritori does not have a scoring system. As such, the Rulebook does not enforce any scoring system.

However, if players intend to use a scoring system, they are encourged to keep these principles in mind:

- Points should not be awarded for speed. Rushed or simple drawings should not be rewarded.
- Word length should not be a major factor in scoring. Instead, consider rewarding word uniqueness or subject similarity.
- Arrows and circles are ugly. Players should be encouraged to create drawings that naturally focus on the desired object.
