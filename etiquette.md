# Players' Etiquette

## Violating a rule

If a rule is violated, the game must be stopped immediately. The offending player may be forced to forfeit the game, if the offense is deemed severe.

## Disputing

In the event that a player deems a word or a drawing unsatisfactory, they may dispute the offending word or drawing. This dispute must occur within one(1) turn or two(2) minutes of the offense, whichever is longer.

Upon dispute, the game must be stopped immediately. The game must not proceed until the dispute is resolved.

## Respectful behaviour

Although drawing is a large part of picture shiritori, players should be mindful that drawing skill can vary wildly from person to person. Players are to refrain from mocking or insulting other players' drawings. Trash-talking, taunting, and other demeaning behaviours are strongly discouraged. Players should maintain an atmosphere of respectful competition during a match.
