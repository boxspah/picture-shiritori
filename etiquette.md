# Players' Etiquette

## Violating a rule

If a rule is violated, the game must be stopped immediately. The offending player may be forced to forfeit the game, if the offense is deemed severe.

## Disputing

In the event that a player deems a word or a drawing unsatisfactory, they may dispute the offending word or drawing. This dispute must occur within one(1) turn or two(2) minutes of the offense, whichever is longer.

Upon dispute, the game must be stopped immediately. The game must not proceed until the dispute is resolved.
