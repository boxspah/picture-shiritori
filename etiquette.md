# Players' Etiquette

## Rule violations

If a rule is violated, the match must be stopped immediately. The offending player may be forced to forfeit the match, if the offense is severe. The match may continue after the offending player is removed from the match or is given a formal warning.

## Disputes

In the event that a player deems a word or a drawing unsatisfactory, they may dispute said word or drawing. This dispute must occur within one (1) turn or two (2) minutes of the offense, whichever is longer.

Upon dispute, the match must be stopped immediately. The match must not proceed until the dispute is resolved.

## Respectful behaviour

Players should be mindful that drawing skill can varies from person to person. Players should refrain from mocking or insulting other players' drawings. Trash-talking, taunting, and other demeaning behaviours are strongly discouraged and offenders may be disciplined. Players should maintain an atmosphere of respectful competition during a match. All above statements regarding respectful behaviour extend to spectators, particularly when spectators' remarks are audible or visible to players.

## Time warnings

If playing with a timer, the timekeeper should inform players when their turn time is about to run out. Warnings should be given at the halfway mark and at a time after the halfway mark. Ideally, the final warning is given with enough time for the player to submit their current drawing and word, even if incomplete.
